Certainly! Here's a brief description of the project:

The project is focused on building a document search system. It consists of several components and functionalities implemented in Java. The main tasks of the project are as follows:

1. Automatic Indexing Program:
   - This program is responsible for indexing a set of text files (.txt).
   - It reads the content of the text files and creates an index, which is a data structure that maps words to the files in which they appear.

2. Information Retrieval Program:
   - This program implements two retrieval models: the Boolean model and the Vector Space model.
   - The Boolean model is used to perform boolean searches, where users can enter a set of keywords to retrieve documents that contain all the specified keywords.
   - The Vector Space model is used to perform vectorial searches, where users can enter a query and retrieve documents based on their relevance to the query.

3. Main Program (Main()):
   - This program serves as the main entry point for the application.
   - It allows the user to execute the following actions:
     - Launch the indexing program to create an index of text files.
     - Prompt the user to enter a search query (a set of keywords).
     - Perform a boolean search using the entered query and display the found results.
     - Perform a vectorial search using the entered query and display the found results.

4. Additional Functionality (Optional):
   - Extended Boolean Model: The project includes an extended version of the Boolean model.
   - Wordnet Ontology: The Wordnet ontology is introduced, which can be used to enhance the search capabilities.

The project is designed to be an individual assignment, where each student is required to submit their work as a compressed directory containing their code. The project presentation is scheduled on specific dates for each campus.

The programming language used for this project is Java, and it offers flexibility in terms of choosing the language.

Overall, the project aims to provide a comprehensive search system that indexes and retrieves information from text files, allowing users to perform effective searches based on different models and techniques.

I hope this description gives you a clear overview of the project. Let me know if you have any further questions!
